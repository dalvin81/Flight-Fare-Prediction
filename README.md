# END TO END DATA SCIENCE PROJECT

The aim of this project is to follow industry coding practices such as enviroment creation, requirements file for better portability, exception handling and logging for easier debugging.

I have cleaned and transformed dataset (source:[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction)). Later, utilized predictive modeling to forecast flight fares. I have developed a web application using Flask encompassing this project. For continuous deployment and seamless integration, please try deploying on cloud using AWS. I used AWS Elastic Beanstalk to do the same.
